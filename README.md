# stock-analysis with VBA
click here for the excel file: 
## Overview of Project

Steve is planning to do more research for his parents. He wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market.
The stock analysis VBA code we developed in module 2 might not work as well and take a long time to excecute for a larger amount of stocks.

Therefore the purpose of the project is to restructure the existing code in a way that improves the internal structure but doesn't change its external behavior.
We arenâ€™t adding new functionality; but want to make the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read

## Results

Analysis

First I copied the starter code into the Visual Basic Editor

I reused the existing code from the starter code to 
- set up the Timer
- create the InputBox
- activate the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet
- add the header, header row and initialize the array of tickers with the ticker values
- activate the yearValue worksheet
- and get the number of rows in the sheet to loop over

1a) I then created a ticker index that will later be used to access the arrays created in Step 1b)
